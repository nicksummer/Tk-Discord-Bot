# Tarkov TK

### NOTICE

Hey everyone, Kyle here. Sorry to say but Tarkov TK has shut down. The cost of hosting the bot has risen to over $30 a month, and as it doesn't generate income I can't justify keeping it running.

The code for the bot is available here on Github https://github.com/kyleshepherd/discord-tk-bot so if anyone would like to run their own then feel free (worth noting the code could do with a fair bit of refactoring).

I'm available to contact via my Twitter if anyone has any questions about running their own version, or receiving their server data https://twitter.com/kyleshepherddev?lang=en

# About the bot

Tarkov TK is a Discord bot built for tracking team kills in Escape From Tarkov.

The bot can be installed via this link: <a href="https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=686242341442289737&scope=bot" target="_blank">Install Bot</a>

Once the bot is installed in your server, you can initalise it by sending the command `!tkstart` in your server. You can then do things such as:

<ul>
<li>Log a team kill</li>
<li>View players with the most team kills</li>
<li>View players with the most team deaths</li>
<li>View individual player stats</li>
</ul>

Type `!tkhelp` for guidance on using the bot's commands and `!tkinfo` for some info about the project and how you can support me in developing it further.

Any suggestions or issues, send me a DM on <a href="https://twitter.com/KyleShepherdDev" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, and if you'd care to support me, check out my <a href="https://ko-fi.com/kyleshepherd" target="_blank">Kofi</a>
