# Tarkov TK

### NOTICE

Hey everyone, Kyle here. Sorry to say but Tarkov TK has shut down. The cost of hosting the bot has risen to over $30 a month, and as it doesn't generate income I can't justify keeping it running.

The code for the bot is available here on Github https://github.com/kyleshepherd/discord-tk-bot so if anyone would like to run their own then feel free (worth noting the code could do with a fair bit of refactoring).

I'm available to contact via my Twitter if anyone has any questions about running their own version, or receiving their server data https://twitter.com/kyleshepherddev?lang=en
